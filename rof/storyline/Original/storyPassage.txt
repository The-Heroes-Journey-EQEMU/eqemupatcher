The Hidden Passage
 <br><br>
As Morden Rasp's camp of adventurers grew and readied for an expedition, the Overking Bathezid Di`Zok in Chardok called a secret council to his chambers.  Those closest to the Overking were suspicious of Korucust's actions of late. 
  <br><br>
Over the past decade, Korucust ascended the ranks to become a trusted member of the Overking's security forces and had been rampantly making accusations of treachery within the brood.  He pointed his finger at some of the most powerful Di`Zok and those he charged disappeared into his interrogation chambers. 
  <br><br>
The Overking observed that Korucust often vanished for days at a time with no explanation and it concerned him. 
  <br><br>	
This night, the Overking's assembled council planned to pool its magic for a spell of powerful vision that would allow them to see into Korucust's rooms without detection.
  <br><br>	
The dozen members of the secret council filtered into the chambers and sat in a loose circle around the Overking. 
  <br><br>
One of the mages began to mutter an incantation.  Then, another began.  And another.  Soon, the echoes of the chanting voices took an airy form, a window of sight, which the Overking controlled with his own mind.  He willed the magic eye through the deep caverns of Chardok to Korucust's rooms.
  <br><br>
He inched the eye through a wall where faint squeals emanated. 
  <br><br>
Gasps stole the air in the Overking's chamber as horror robbed the mages of their breath.
  <br><br>
The Overking's own blood chilled and his heart darkened as he watched Korucust torture Gimliox Ran`Ti, one of the palace's master healers. 
  <br><br>
The only words Korucust uttered were in a necromantic language.  His blood-coated arms were ablaze with a dark red magical energy.   
  <br><br>
Gimliox's screams began to ebb and his eyes slowly rolled under his scaled lids.  Calm washed over his reptilian features.  
   <br><br>
The Overking immediately understood the extremity of the sinister arts that Korucust practiced.
  <br><br>
Gimliox wandered mindlessly into a dark hall after Korucust unshackled him.  He could be heard muttering phrases of nonsense drawn from his shattered mind.
 <br><br>
"I am Shai`Din.  The Brood of Di`Zok is my enemy.  I am Shai`Din.  I am Shai`Din.  Enemies are close."
