Seeking the Stone
<br><br>
Trapped in the chaos of his mind, Calliav continued to stagger through the Plane of Knowledge for many days, aching for calm and relief.  
<br><br>
As he wandered, Calliav caught the murmurs of passing Norrathians.  There was talk about a band of adventurers, the Wayfarers Brotherhood, that had garnered a great reputation of success with uncovering intrigue, information, and treasures.
<br><br>
It was clear to Calliav that he ought to seek out the leader of this crew of explorers, Morden Rasp.  He would send a messenger to request his help very soon.  In the meantime, Calliav had to continue his research into the repeated, haunting vision of a glowing stone.  He believed it to be the magical stone that was stolen from the trolls -- the Grozmok Stone.  
<br><br>
While in the Lavastorm Mountains, Morden, Nedaria, and Tondal received word that a raving madman in the Plane of Knowledge was seeking their assistance to find an object --  a stone -- of grave importance.  Naturally intrigued, Morden wanted to learn more, but was uneducated about travel to and from the planes.  Twice he had sent messengers to get word to the lunatic, but had heard nothing more.
<br><br>
If the news about the madman was true, Morden and his friends might face their greatest adventure yet.  Morden and Nedaria were well aware of the history of the Grozmok Stone and were very curious to see if the madman might know more about it.  The idea was an alluring proposition for another reason -- now that Morden's band of outcasts and exiles rivaled any powerful group of explorers on Norrath, Morden wanted to prove the worth of his legion to the world.  In some small way, he hoped word about the Wayfarers Brotherhood would make its way back to the Rogues of the White Rose in Halas -- the ones who cast him out in the snowy wilds.  But, mostly, Morden was confident his new family could take on any challenge.  No one knew how to face adversity like him and the rest of the Wayfarers Brotherhood.
<br><br>
Morden's second messenger returned, finally, and told Morden that the madman, named Calliav, could arrive on Norrath at any time and that he would most likely find his way to the city of Freeport. 
<br><br>
Nedaria agreed to lead the growing camp in the Lavastorm Mountains while Morden and Tondal ran to Freeport.  Tondal was familiar with the underground labyrinth of the sewers of the city.  
<br><br>
The two companions ran with the shadows in Nektulos forest and slipped past the guards in the Commonlands.  Tondal led Morden to the hidden entrance to the Freeport sewers.  As they crept through the darkness, they came upon a pedestal holding a book.  It emitted a power that made the hair on the back of Morden's neck stand on end.  
<br><br>
The two edged their way around a corner to observe this strange object pulsating with magic.  It wasn't long before a low hum stirred from the book on the pedestal.  The sound had such a deep resonance that Morden's teeth chattered.  Tondal felt his chest vibrate as he watched a puddle of slime ripple at his feet.  
<br><br>
The two shared a confused glance when a crimson glow began to fill the slippery tunnels of the sewer.
