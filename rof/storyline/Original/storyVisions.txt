Visions of Chaos
<br><br>
Under the flickering torchlight in the tunnel in the Commonlands, Calliav set his weary eyes upon his three new friends, Morden Rasp, Nedaria Debiean, and Tondal Di'Xevar. Several days earlier, he sent word asking for them all to meet.  He had something to tell them.  Something important.
<br><br>
"Thank you for meeting with me.  It's wonderful to see  us all together again," Calliav said with as much cheer as he could muster.  "First, I want to thank all of you for taking me in, especially in the raving and maddened state I seemed to be in."
<br><br>
"Aye, it weren't nothin' dear friend. Ye've set me and me friends on a course we wouldn't dare dreamed of.  And ye are lookin' a might better, Calliav," Morden said.
<br><br>
"Indeed.  With time and Nedaria's help, I've been able to conquer my thoughts again.  But, there is one vision that I can't seem to suppress in any way," Calliav said with a worried expression.
<br><br>
Nedaria put a hand on his shoulder.
<br><br>
"Don't be afraid to tell us what is on your mind Calliav," she said.  "We are well aware by now that you are not the madman you appeared to be.  I believe all you say is true and I can convince these other two of the same, no matter how much they may try to taunt you with their poor humor."
<br><br>
Morden and Tondal looked at each other and shrugged, feigning ignorance.  They both turned to Calliav and smiled, encouraging him to continue.
<br><br>
"Well, as you know, in our search for the Grozmok Stone, adventurers all over Norrath are turning up strange minerals and gems that appear to be imbued with varying powers," Calliav said.  "I took it upon myself to start collecting them to see if they were perhaps shattered pieces of the Grozmok Stone."
<br><br>
As Calliav mentioned the Grozmok Stone, Morden's eyes became stern and Nedaria looked uncomfortable, shifting on her feet where she stood.  Tondal looked to Morden and Nedaria with a strange expression.  Calliav didn't seem to notice any of the tension as he continued.
<br><br>
"I noticed there is some kind of force that is created as more of these materials are put close together, much like a magnetic force," Calliav looked at his friends, his face set in a sheepish expression.  "The stones seem to be acting like a compass of some sort."
<br><br>
"Sounds reasonable to me.  What else?  I can see there is more ye are wantin' to say, friend.  Of all the strange things we've discovered, I'd say this one is a wee bit mild so far, eh?" Morden said reassuringly.
<br><br>
"Well, that vision I mentioned?  The one that won't go away?  Well, I . . .," Calliav's voice trailed off and he stood silent, his eyes cast to the floor.
<br><br>
"Please Calliav!  You can't just leave us in suspense.  We trusted all you said before even though we were nearly certain it couldn't be true.  Trust us now else I go mad on you!" Tondal said, a dark-skinned smile spreading across his sharp features.
<br><br>
"The truth is that we have barely scratched the surface I fear.  While the Grozmok Stone is still very important somehow, there is something else, something dark on the horizon.  I fear for Norrath.  I really do fear for us all," he said.
<br><br>
"What is it, Calliav?" Nedaria asked. "In our time together and all the times I've sensed what runs through your mind, I've not seen anything that threatens all of us."
<br><br>
"There is nothing to see Nedaria.  No one has ever laid eyes on this threat, this evil.  I can sense it more than see it," Calliav said.  "Zebuxoruk gave me this knowledge for a reason and I believe he intended for all of us to prepare."
<br><br>
"Prepare for what?" Morden asked.
<br><br>	"A war of the likes we have never seen.  All of Norrath, good and evil, must band together if we wish to survive."
