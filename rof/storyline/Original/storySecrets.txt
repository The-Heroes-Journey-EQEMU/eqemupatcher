Secrets in the Solusek Mines
<br><br>
Chalky fingers wiggled through a crack in the wall, deftly whittling the mortar and stone apart a little further.  The fingers disappeared and then a muffled, repetitive thud came from behind the wall.  There was a loud crack as the stone wall split apart. With one more thud the stones in the wall broke free and marked the mossy ground. 
<br><br>
	All was still for a moment.
<br><br>
	Slowly, a dusty figure squirmed sideways through the fracture in the wall and worked its way outside.  Coughing quietly and wafting the dust from his face, Morden Rasp squinted as he adjusted to the light of the day. 
<br><br>
	He reached back behind the wall and pulled out a number of lightly packed bags that clanged as they shifted in his grasp.  A grin broke the sternness of Morden's face.  Delighted about the treasures he lifted from the deepest halls of Chardok, Morden made his way to his camp.
<br><br><br>
	Morden appeared out of the heavy mist, waving his bags.
<br><br>
	"Do you have enough to satisfy you for now?" Nedaria asked dryly. 
<br><br>
	"There is no such thing as satisfied, me dear," snickered Morden.
<br><br>
	Nedaria showed Morden a scribbled note that was delivered earlier that day from an oasis in the deserts of Ro.
<br><br>
	"The Solusek Mining Company has sent word that the kobold tribes are more active than usual.  The gnomes made mention of some sort of uprising.  If the kobolds cause a great enough disturbance in Solusek's Eye, it will be interesting to watch if nothing else," Nedaria said. "These activities may open up great opportunities for us should they reach as deep as Nagafen's Lair." 
<br><br>
	Morden's eyes lit up.
<br><br>
	"I know those lands well," Tondal said. "I remember them from my travels as a youth.  We servants often accompanied our masters during journeys beyond Neriak's gates," Tondal grinned, happy to be of greater value to Morden and Nedaria.
<br><br>
	Excited about a new adventure, Morden gathered the ever-increasing number of adventurers around him and gave them the order to start packing up the camp.  It wouldn't be long before the adventurers would hoist the sail on the Thorn of the White Rose.
