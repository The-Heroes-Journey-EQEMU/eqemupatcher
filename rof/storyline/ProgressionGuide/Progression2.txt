<br><c "#35db24">Kunark</c><br><br>

Kunark introduces the first expansion ever released to EverQuest. In <c "#ffd700">The Hero's Journey</c>, here's a list of things worth noting about Kunark that are unique to other servers:<br><br>

• No new <c "#ffd700">AAs</c> are introduced in Kunark<br>
• No keys are required for <c "#dc7633">Howling Stones (Charasis)</c> or <c "#dc7633">Sebilis</c> (this includes zoning INTO these zones, as well as accessing areas inside them)<br>
• To access <c "#dc7633">Veeshan's Peak</c>, you must kill the 4 dragons of Kunark<br>
• <c "#dc7633">Veeshan's Peak</c> is 1.0 version, making it in line with Kunark era loot<br>
• Legacy of Ykesha zones are unlocked with Kunark, as well as <c "#dc7633">Stonebrunt Mountains</c>, <c "#dc7633">Jaggedpine Forest</c>, <c "#dc7633">ChardokB</c>, and <c "#dc7633">Veksar</c>. Note that <c "#dc7633">Soldungc</c> is NOT unlocked until PoP.<br>
• Legacy of Ykesha gear was reduced to put it more in line with Kunark era loot<br>
• Charms are obtainable in Legacy of Ykesha zones. (They are not amazing, but you can fill the slot now at least)<br><br>
