<c "#35db24">Lord Nagafen</c><br> 
<br>
<c "#ffd700">Information</c>:<br>
Fire breathing boss of EverQuest (classic). Icon of the game. Appeared on the original box art and featured in the original promotional artwork.<br>
The fire dragon Nagafen lives in exile from all dragonkind due to a plot with Lady Vox to create another prismatic dragon similar to Kerafyrm.<br>
Lord Nagafen, along with Lady Vox and Phinigel Autropos, is one of EverQuest's original three raid bosses. He resides in the very rear of <c "#dc7633">Nagafen's Lair</c>, guarded by the fire giants.<br>
<br>
<c "#ffd700">Strategy</c>:<br>

The key to defeating him is avoiding the two special attacks he has: an Area Effect fire spell and an Area Effect fear spell. Fire and Magic Resists mean everything with this fellow.

Characters who are over level 52 cannot directly engage Nagafen in combat, as he will banish them from his lair upon gaining aggro.<br>
*(implemented in the June 25th 2011 patch on P1999, and ~3 months after the release of Kunark on live).
