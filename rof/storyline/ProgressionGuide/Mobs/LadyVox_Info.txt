<c "#35db24">Lady Vox</c><br>
<br>
<c "#ffd700">Information</c>:<br>
Vox, the frost dragon, was banished from the Claws of Veeshan for plotting with Lord Nagafen to breed another prismatic dragon like Kerafyrm.
Lady Vox, along with Lord Nagafen and Phinigel Autropos, is one of EverQuest's original three raid bosses. She resides deep within <c "#dc7633">Permafrost</c>, guarded by ice giants.<br>
<c "#dc7633">Casts</c>: Dragon Roar (AoE Fear), Frost Breath (PB AoE 500 Cold Damage + Cancel Magic), Complete Heal.<br>
Blindable
<br><br>
<c "#ffd700">Strategy</c>:<br>
Those who would challenge the ice dragon would be advised to increase their Magic and Cold resists to counter her Fear and Ice AEs, respectively. She is also a cleric, and, as such, possesses the ability to cast Complete Heal on herself. You should try to prevent this.
Characters who are over level 52 cannot directly engage Vox in combat, as she will banish them from her lair upon gaining aggro. <br>
*(Implemented in the June 13th 2011 patch on P1999, although it wasn't mentioned in the patch notes until the following June 25th 2011 patch. On live it was implemented ~3 months after the release of Kunark).
