<c "#35db24"> Post-Flag - Plane of Knowledge</c><br><br>
Now go talk to Seer Mal Nae`Shi in the Plane of Knowledge, sit down and say to her, "Unlock my memories." 
<br><br>
Now talk to Gram Dunnar in that same building and say, 'I will tell you stories.' to wrap up this leg of the progression and get a possible upgrade to your Intricate Wooden Totem and / or AA(s) (you don't get these everytime).
