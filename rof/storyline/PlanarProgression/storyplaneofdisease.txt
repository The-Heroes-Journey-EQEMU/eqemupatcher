<br><br>

<c "#35db24"> Pre-Flag - Plane of Tranquility</c><br>
Talk to Adler Fuirstel in the Plane of Tranquility, who is near the Plane of Disease portal (faucet). Hail him and say, 'What Ward?'
<br><br>
Head into the Plane of Disease and go to the top of the Castle to kill Gryme the Crypt Guardian and loot Gryme's Crypt Key.
<br><br>
Use Gryme's Crypt Key to open the Castle doo and head in to find and kill Aramin the Spider Guardian.
<br><br>
Clear your way to Grummus
<br><br>
Once Grummus is dead, A Planar Projection will appear. Hail A Planar Projection to get your flag text.
<br><br>
Now go on down into the pit in order to zone into the Ruins of Lxanvom, to complete the flag.
<br><br>


<c "#35db24"> Post-Flag - Plane of Tranquility</c><br>
Go back and talk to Adler Fuirstel in the Plane of Tranquility, again.
<br><br>
<c "#35db24"> Post-Flag - Plane of Knowledge</c><br>
Now go talk to Seer Mal Nae`Shi in the Plane of Knowledge, sit down and say to her, "Unlock my memories." 
<br><br>
Now talk to Gram Dunnar in that same building and say, 'I will tell you stories.' to wrap up this leg of the progression and get a possible upgrade to your Intricate Wooden Totem and / or AA(s) (you don't get these everytime).
