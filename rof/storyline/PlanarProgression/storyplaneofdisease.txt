<br><br>

<c "#35db24"> Pre-Flag - Plane of Tranquility</c><br>
Talk to <c "#dc7633">Adler Fuirstel</c> in the Plane of Tranquility, who is near the Plane of Disease portal (faucet). <c "#ffff00">Hail</c> him, and follow his dialog.
<br><c "#dcdc99">You receive a character flag!</c><br><br>
Head into the <c "#35db24">Plane of Disease</c> and go to the top of the Castle to kill <c "#ff0000">Gryme the Crypt Guardian</c> and loot <c "#ffd700">Gryme's Crypt Key</c>.
<br><br>
Use <c "#ffd700">Gryme's Crypt Key</c> to open the Castle door and head in to find and kill <c "#ff0000">Aramin the Spider Guardian</c>.
<br><br>
Clear your way to <c "#ff0000">Grummus</c> and kill him.
<br><c "#dcdc99">You receive a character flag!</c>
<br><br>
A Planar Projection will appear. You don't need to hail.
<br><br>
Now zone into the pit in order to zone into the <c "#35db24">Ruins of Lxanvom</c>, to complete the flag. Zone out and return to <c "#dc7633">Adler Fuirstel</c>, <c "#ffff00">Hail</c> him, and head to the <c "#35db24">Sick Bay</c> (loc: -286, -1407, -906). find <c "#dc7633">Elder Fuirstel</c>, <c "#ffff00">Hail</c> him.
