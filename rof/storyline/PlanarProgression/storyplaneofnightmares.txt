<c "#ff0000">PLANE OF NIGHTMARES</c>
<br><br>
<c "#35db24"> Pre-Flag - Plane of Tranquility</c><br>
Head over to Adroha Jezith and Elder Poxbourne in the Plane of Tranquility (in a building in the area of /waypoint -255, -1420), hail them and follow along (key phrase, 'Tortured by Nightmares?).'
<br><br>
<c "#35db24"> Part One- Hedge Maze Event</c><br>
Head into the Plane of Nightmare and go to the far northeast (across the water) to find some hedges, to talk to Thelin Poxbourne and follow along to get this raid. Keyword, 'Ready.' The say 'Ready' to teleport inside the hedge maze (not an instance).
<br><br>
Once inside the hedge maze, you are to follow and protect Thelin Poxbourne from all sorts of attackers as he meanders about looking for pieces of a dagger (he can get himself killed as he also fights). Once he finds the final piece, A Construct of Nightmares will attack. Kill it!
<br><br>
Once you have finished off A Construct of Nightmares, loot the Dagger Blade Shard and give it to Thelin Poxbourne. Terris Thule will then make a brief appearance, disappoint Thelin and then leave (no battle). After she leaves, hail Thelin and you will be transported out of the maze and receive your character flag.


<c "#35db24"> Part Two - Terris Thule</c><br>
<br><br>
Head to the Lair of Terris Thule to do this raid / event. Fight your way into where Terris Thule is located (at the end of the path, in a building).
<br><br>
Attack Terris Thule. When Terris Thule is atÂ 75% health, she will spawn a good number of a Dream Defiler. Kill them.
<br><br>
When Terris Thule is at 50% health, she will dispell 12 buffs from everyone. 
<br><br>
When Terris Thule is at 35% the 'statues' in the room come to life (A Grotesque Statue). Kill them and finish off Terris Thule.
<br><br>
A Planar Projection will appear. Hail it for your flag.
<br><br>


<c "#35db24"> Post-Flag - Plane of Knowledge</c><br>
Now go talk to Seer Mal Nae`Shi in the Plane of Knowledge, sit down and say to her, "Unlock my memories." 
<br><br>
Now talk to Gram Dunnar in that same building and say, 'I will tell you stories.' to wrap up this leg of the progression and get a possible upgrade to your Intricate Wooden Totem and / or AA(s) (you don't get these everytime).
