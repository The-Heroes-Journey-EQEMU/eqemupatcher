<c "#ff0000">Vegarlson, the Earthen Badlands (Plane of Earth A)</c>
<br><br>

<c "#35db24"> ***Note - Loot to collect while in this zone and/or Earth B***</c><br>
While killing trash, look for <c "#ffd700">Liquefied Earth</c> and <c "#ffd700">Shattered Crystal</c>.<br>
One each of these will be needed later to craft the Plane of Time key.<br><br>



This zone is broken up into three main areas.<br>
The first area, near the middle of the zone, is a key holder mob needed to progress to the final boss. I recommend doing him first.<br>
The main area holds four ring type events; (Rock Golems, Mud Golems, Vines, and Elementals).<br>
And finally the boss mob of this zone <c "#ff0000">A Mystical Arbitor of Earth</c><br><br>

<c "#35db24"> Key Holder - Tantisala Jaggedtooth</c><br><br>
In the middle of the zone is a very large crocodile named <c "#ff0000">Tantisala Jaggedtooth</c><br>
Upon killing him, you will receive a key that allows you to get to the boss of this zone.<br><br>
