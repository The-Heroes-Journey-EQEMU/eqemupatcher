<c "#ff0000">TEMPLE OF MARR</c>
<br><br>

<c "#35db24"> Part 1 - Ralthazor, Champion of Marr</c><br>
Make you way thru the zone to the room with <c "#ff0000">Ralthazor, Champion of Marr</c> , kill him to make 
<c "#ff0000">Lord Mithaniel Marr</c> targetable.<br><br>
<c "#35db24"> Part 2 - Lord Mithaniel Marr</c><br>
Clear the adds around <c "#ff0000">Lord Mithaniel Marr</c> , and then kill him. Once he is dead, <c "#dc7633">A Planar Projection</c> will spawn. Hail him for your flag.<br><br>

<c "#35db24"> Post-Flag - Plane of Knowledge</c><br><br>
Now go talk to Seer Mal Nae`Shi in the Plane of Knowledge, sit down and say to her, "Unlock my memories." 
<br><br>
Now talk to Gram Dunnar in that same building and say, 'I will tell you stories.' to wrap up this leg of the progression and get a possible upgrade to your Intricate Wooden Totem and / or AA(s) (you don't get these everytime).
