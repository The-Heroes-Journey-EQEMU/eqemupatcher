<c "#ff0000">Eryslai, the Kingdom of Wind (Plane of Air)</c>
<br><br>


<c "#35db24"> ***Note - Loot to collect while in this zone***</c><br>
While killing trash, look for <c "#ffd700">Alabaster Beak</c> and <c "#ffd700">Ivory Stormrider Canine</c>.<br>
One each of these will be needed later to craft the <c "#35db24">Plane of Time key</c>.<br><br>


<c "#35db24"> Part One - Wind Etched Key - Key to Xegony Island</c><br><br>
To gain the <c "#ffd700">Wind Etched Key</c> you will need to gather five items:<br>
<c "#ffd700">
Pouch of Swirling Winds<br>
Mystical Essence of Wind<br>
Mystical Essence of Smoke<br>
Mystical Essence of Mist<br>
Mystical Essence of Dust<br></c>
Combine the four Essences in the Pouch to obtain the <c "#ffd700">Wind Etched Key</c><br><br>
The Mysical Essences drop from various Wing Bosses called the Avatar’s. You must first complete a ring event to spawn each Avatar. The Avatar’s are triggered from the corresponding ring.<br><br>


<c "#35db24"> Stormrider Ring</c><br><br>
1) Clear all mobs from the island. Once the island is clear, several <c "#ff0000">stormriders</c> spawn in front of the <c "#ff0000">Stormrider Priest of Destruction.</c>.<br>
The stormriders will become targetable in waves of two, and once all are dead, you may attack <c "#ff0000">Stormrider Priest of Destruction.</c>
2) During the next 5 to 10 minutes, more mobs will spawn, eventually leading to <c "#ff0000">Pherlondien Clawpikes</c>.<br>
Continue killing these until <c "#ff0000">Avatar of Wind</c> spawns. Kill him and collect <c "#ffd700">Essence of Wind</c>.<br><br>


<c "#35db24"> Elemental Ring</c><br><br>
Clear all mobs from the island. Once the island is clear, several <c "#ff0000">an elemental champion</c>'s spawn.<br>
When the last champion dies, <c "#ff0000">The Elemental Masterpiece</c> will spawn, kill him to spawn <c "#ff0000">Avatar of Smoke</c> in his temple. Locate him in his temple and Kill him and collect <c "#ffd700">Essence of Smoke</c>.<br><br>

<c "#35db24"> Phoenix Ring</c><br><br>
Clear all mobs from the island. Once the island is clear, several <c "#ff0000">a phoenix firesurger</c>'s will spawn.<br>
When the last firesurger dies, <c "#ff0000">Melernil Faal`Armanna</c> will spawn, kill him to spawn <c "#ff0000">Avatar of Mist</c> in his temple. Locate him in his temple and Kill him and collect  <c "#ffd700">Essence of Mist</c>.<br>

<c "#35db24">Spider Ring</c><br><br>
Clear all mobs from the island. Once the island is clear, several <c "#ff0000">an erratic arachnidc</c>'s will spawn. These will continue to spawn throught the event.<br>
At the same time, <c "#ff0000">a vorladien archwalker</c> will spawn. Killing this will spawn three <c "#ff0000">a vorladien spawn</c>, kill these, and another archwalker will take it's place. Repeat this 3 times.<br>
When the last archwalker dies, <c "#ff0000">Sigismond Windwalker</c> will spawn, kill him to spawn <c "#ff0000">Avatar of Dust</c> in his temple. Locate him in his temple and Kill him and collect <c "#ffd700">Essence of Dust</c>.<br><br>
<c "#35db24"> Part Two - Xegony</c><br><br>
<c "#ff0000">Xegony, The Queen of Air</c> is again a pretty straight forward fight.<br>
Engage her, and every 15%, she will spawn several adds. When you kill her.
<br><c "#dada99">You receive a character flag!</c><br>
You receive <c "#ffd700">Amorphous Cloud of Air</c>(needed for <c "#35db24">Plane of Time</c> key.
<br><br>
A Essence of Wind will spawn, you don't need to Hail it.
