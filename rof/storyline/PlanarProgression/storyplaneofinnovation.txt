<c "#35db24"> Pre-Flag - Factory Key</c><br><br>
Kill trash until you find three items<br>
    <c "#ffd700">Copper Node</c><br>
    <c "#ffd700">Bundle of Super Conductive Wires</c><br>
    <c "#ffd700">Intact Power Cell</c><br>
Give these three items to <c "#dc7633">Nitram Anizok</c><br>
Follow him thru the zone (yes, the whole zone), where he will eventually take you to <c "#ff0000">Xanamech Nezmirthafen"</c> who you will need to kill.<br>
Hail Nitram and then head to the factory to finalize your Factory Key.<br>
<br>
<c "#35db24"> Manaetic Behemoth Event</c><br>
<br>
Just inside, you should find a gnome named <c "#dc7633">Giwin Mirakon</c>. Hail him and say, "I will test the machine."
<br>
Head into the Factory to find Manaetic Behemoth (/waypoint -0.85, 1140), who is in a room that has a door on either side. A clockwork device will come in from both doors. Kill a clockwork device keeping them out of the main room until Manaetic Behemoth activates (Approx 5 minutes), then kill Manaetic Behemoth.
<br><br>
Once Manaetic Behemoth is dead, talk to Giwin Mirakon for a flag.
<br><br>
<c "#35db24"> Post-Flag - Plane of Knowledge</c><br><br>
Now go talk to Seer Mal Nae`Shi in the Plane of Knowledge, sit down and say to her, "Unlock my memories." 
<br><br>
Now talk to Gram Dunnar in that same building and say, 'I will tell you stories.' to wrap up this leg of the progression and get a possible upgrade to your Intricate Wooden Totem and / or AA(s) (you don't get these everytime).
