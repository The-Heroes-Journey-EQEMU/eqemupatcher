<c "#ff0000">DRUNDER, THE FORTRESS OF ZEK (PLANE OF TACTICS)</c>
<br><br>
<c "#35db24"> Part 1 - Tallon Zek</c><br><br>
<c "#ff0000">Tallon Zek</c> will shadow-step around the room. Other than that, he is a straight fight.<br>
Once he is dead, <c "#dc7633">A Planar Projection</c> will appear. Hail it for your flag. You can zone out by clicking the wall where Tallon was originally standing (panel on wall).
<br><br>

<c "#35db24"> Part 2 - Vallon Zek</c><br><br>
At about 40% <c "#ff0000">Vallon Zek</c> will split into 5 versions of himself... only one of which is the real Vallon Zek. The idea is to pick out the real Vallon Zek (if you don't, you can get five more splits).<br>
Once they are all dead, <c "#dc7633">A Planar Projection</c> will appear. Hail it for your flag. You can zone out by clicking the wall where Vallon was originally standing (panel on wall).
<br><br>

<c "#35db24"> Part 3 - Rallos Zek the Warlord</c><br><br>
Head into Drunder, Fortress of Zek. Head up the steps on the far side of the pit / arena and go up the steps there. You are after <c "#ff0000">Decorin Berik</c> and <c "#ff0000">Decorin Grunhork</c>.<br>They will need to be killed within a very short time of each other.<br><br>
Once they are dead, this will spawn <c "#ff0000">Tallon Zek</c>. This fight is identical to his fight above.
<br><br>
Once he is dead, <c "#ff0000">Vallon Zek</c>. This fight is identical to his fight above.
<br><br>
Once done, go up the steps to the north to engage <c "#ff0000">Rallos Zek the Warlord</c>. He will despawn (port away) at 50% and reappear in the pit / arena. WARNING: Do NOT over DPS him! If you kill him at this point, he will not respawn in the pit and the event will fail. 
<br><br>
After he despawns, hurry down to the pit / area as you are now on a timer (he will despawn after 30 minutes, even if you are actively in battle with him). Finish off <c "#ff0000">Rallos Zek the Warlord</c>. Deal with the adds as necessary.<br><br>
Once he is dead, <c "#dc7633">A Planar Projection</c> will spawn. Hail him for your flag.<br><br>










<c "#35db24"> Post-Flag - Plane of Knowledge</c><br><br>
Now go talk to Seer Mal Nae`Shi in the Plane of Knowledge, sit down and say to her, "Unlock my memories." 
<br><br>
Now talk to Gram Dunnar in that same building and say, 'I will tell you stories.' to wrap up this leg of the progression and get a possible upgrade to your Intricate Wooden Totem and / or AA(s) (you don't get these everytime).
